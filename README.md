# SAP Conversational AI - SDK PHP
SAP Conversational AI official SDK in PHP

## Synospis

This module is a wrapper around the [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/Analyse-text)
* [Manage your conversation](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/Manage-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/Receive-and-send-messages)


## Installation

Install the package using npm, as shown below:
```bash
composer require sapcai/sdk-php
```

You can now use the SDK in your code. All you need is your bot's token. In case you have enabled our versioning feature in the settings of your bot, you can refer to our [versioning documentation](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning) to learn how to select the appropriate token for you versions and environments.

Using the entire SDK:
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Sapcai\Client;

$client = new Client('YOUR_TOKEN');
```

Extracting one single API:
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Sapcai\Client;

$request = Client::Request('YOUR_TOKEN');
$connect = Client::Connect('YOUR_TOKEN');
```
