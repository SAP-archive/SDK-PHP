# SAP Conversational AI - SDK PHP
SAP Conversational AI official SDK in PHP

# ðŸš¨ Sunset of Open Source SDKs for SAP Conversational AI 
 
SAP Conversational AI provides several SDKs, which are all open-source and hosted on GitHub.  
Starting from January 2021, please note that we inform you that the SDKs will not be available anymore and the public repository of the project will be archived from GitHub.  

## âœ¨ Why are we sunsetting our SDKs? 
 
Firstly, we noticed over the past year that these SDKs were not used much by our users.  
This is because our platform usage has become easier, including the APIs. 

Secondly, our APIs have undergone major changes. We would need to adapt the SDKs in order to keep them working, which will lead to a significant cost from our side. 

Hence, we decided to sunset this open source version starting from January 2021.  
 
## âœ¨ What does it mean for me as a user? 
 
Any changes in our APIâ€™s will not be reflected in our SDKs. Hence, the code might not work unless you adjust the same.  

## âœ¨ What are the next steps? 
 
If you are interested in taking the ownership of the project on GitHub, please get in touch with us and we can discuss the process. Otherwise, if there are no objections from anyone, we would archive the project following the open source sunset process.  

Please use the platform SAP Answers if you have any other questions related to this topic. 
 
Happy bot building! 
 
The SAP Conversational AI team

## Synospis

This module is a wrapper around the [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/Analyse-text)
* [Manage your conversation](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/Manage-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-PHP/wiki/Receive-and-send-messages)


## Installation

Install the package using npm, as shown below:
```bash
composer require sapcai/sdk-php
```

You can now use the SDK in your code. All you need is your bot's token. In case you have enabled our versioning feature in the settings of your bot, you can refer to our [versioning documentation](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning) to learn how to select the appropriate token for you versions and environments.

Using the entire SDK:
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Sapcai\Client;

$client = new Client('YOUR_TOKEN');
```

Extracting one single API:
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Sapcai\Client;

$request = Client::Request('YOUR_TOKEN');
$connect = Client::Connect('YOUR_TOKEN');
```
